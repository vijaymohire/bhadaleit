# Investor Relations Overview

This directory provides public investor-related materials, templates, and summaries for the **Bhadale IT Hub — Quantum AI Foundry** initiatives.

## 🎯 Purpose
To ensure transparency, strategic alignment, and investor readiness across QAI Foundry programs, patent portfolios, and modernization tracks.

It centralizes:
- Investor snapshot templates (for valuation summaries)
- Financial and progress reports (sanitized)
- Corporate communication standards for investor updates

> ⚠️ **Note:** Sensitive valuation and deal documents are maintained privately under GitLab (`bhadaleit-ip-hub/04_Financials_&_Valuations/`).  
> Only non-confidential summaries are hosted here.
