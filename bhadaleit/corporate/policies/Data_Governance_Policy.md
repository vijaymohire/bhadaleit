# 🗄️ Data Governance Policy  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the principles and procedures for **data management, protection, and governance** across all Quantum AI Foundry operations — including public GitHub repositories and private GitLab IP assets.

The goal is to ensure **data integrity, confidentiality, and ethical use** throughout all QAI and QSI research activities.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to all data collected, processed, or generated under:
- **QAI Products and Frameworks**
- **Applied and Theoretical Research**
- **Partner Collaborations and Investor Programs**
- **Automation and Analytics (QAI Ops)**

---

## 3. Data Governance Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Integrity** | Data must remain accurate, complete, and tamper-proof. |
| **Accountability** | Each dataset must have an identified owner (team or module). |
| **Compliance** | All processing complies with regional and international data laws (GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001). |
| **Confidentiality** | Quantum IP and classified datasets remain restricted under GitLab access control. |
| **Ethical Use** | Data may not be used for unethical or discriminatory outcomes. |
| **Traceability** | All data lineage and transformation steps are logged. |

---

## 4. Data Classification

| Level | Description | Storage Location |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Public** | Research summaries, sanitized abstracts, and open-source datasets. | GitHub |
| **Restricted** | Pre-publication data, internal analyses, non-patented research. | Private GitLab |
| **Confidential** | Patent-related data, classified quantum algorithms, and partner datasets. | GitLab encrypted storage |

---

## 5. Data Lifecycle

1. **Acquisition** — Data collected or generated with consent and purpose validation.  
2. **Processing** — Transformation or training under controlled, auditable environments.  
3. **Storage** — Encrypted and version-controlled in authorized repositories.  
4. **Access** — Granted only via approved authentication protocols.  
5. **Archival / Deletion** — Retention schedules applied per compliance rules.

---

## 6. Integration with QAI Ops

This policy is integrated with the **QAI Ops Framework**, automating:
- Data classification tagging  
- Access control via GitOps workflows  
- Backup scheduling and compliance reporting  

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement

Data governance is reviewed bi-annually by the **Corporate Compliance Team**  
and aligned with evolving quantum–AI data security standards.
