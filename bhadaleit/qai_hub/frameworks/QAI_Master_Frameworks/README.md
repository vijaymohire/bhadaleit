# 🧠 QAI Master Frameworks  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Overview

The **QAI Master Frameworks** define the **foundational meta-architecture** of the Quantum AI Foundry.  
They unify the theoretical and applied components of **Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI)** across:

- Classical AI subsystems  
- Quantum neural networks and algorithms  
- Hybrid quantum–classical orchestration  
- Quantum–Synthetic Intelligence (QSI) evolution models  

This framework provides the **blueprint** for all derivative frameworks (Enterprise, Agile, Dev/Deploy Toolkits, Testing, and Quality).

---

## 2. Purpose

To formalize and standardize:
- The **QAI Process** (core hybrid reasoning mechanism)  
- Quantum–classical interaction models  
- Architectural design standards for hybrid QAI systems  
- Patentable structures and patterns across all Foundry modules  

---

## 3. Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **QAI Process** | Defines the life cycle and transformation of hybrid QAI intelligence flows. |
| **QAI Hub Frameworks** | Orchestrates runtime and communication between quantum and classical nodes. |
| **QAI Cloud Integration** | Provides distributed orchestration and quantum offloading. |
| **QAI OS Runtime** | Manages hybrid execution contexts and state synchronization. |
| **QAI Cognitive Layer** | Extends to AGI and ASI architectures (QSI generation). |
