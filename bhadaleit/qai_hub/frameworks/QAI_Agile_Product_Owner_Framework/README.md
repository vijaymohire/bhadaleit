# 🧩 QAI Agile Product Owner Framework  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Overview

The **QAI Agile Product Owner Framework (QAI-APOF)** integrates modern Agile product management with **Quantum AI system design principles**.  
It empowers Product Owners, Researchers, and QAI Engineers to manage **complex hybrid product lifecycles** — from ideation to deployment and IP filing.

---

## 2. Purpose

To enable efficient, ethical, and transparent delivery of QAI products and frameworks through:
- Agile + QAI Process integration  
- Hybrid backlog management (AI + Quantum + Research)  
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines (QAI Ops)  
- IP protection and classification tracking
