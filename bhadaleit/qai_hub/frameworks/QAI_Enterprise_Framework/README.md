# 🏢 QAI Enterprise Framework  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Overview

The **QAI Enterprise Framework (QAI-EF)** enables organizations to adopt and scale **Quantum Artificial Intelligence** through structured transformation models.  
It builds on the **QAI Master Frameworks**, aligning technology innovation with governance, risk management, and enterprise strategy.

---

## 2. Purpose

To guide enterprises in:
- Integrating QAI capabilities within classical IT and business ecosystems.  
- Managing hybrid infrastructure (Cloud, HPC, Datacenter, Edge).  
- Aligning QAI programs with organizational objectives, KPIs, and compliance standards.  
- Establishing **QAI Centers of Excellence (QAI-CoE)** for research and development.

## 5. QAI Enterprise Readiness Index (QAI-ERI)

A maturity model used to assess organizational readiness for QAI transformation:

| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Level 1 – Aware** | Understanding QAI fundamentals. |
| **Level 2 – Experimenting** | Running small pilots or simulations. |
| **Level 3 – Integrated** | Deploying hybrid models in production. |
| **Level 4 – Optimized** | Systematic enterprise-wide QAI strategy. |
| **Level 5 – Autonomous** | Self-evolving QAI and synthetic intelligence operations. |
