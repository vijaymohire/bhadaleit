# 🧩 QAI Hub Frameworks  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Overview

The **QAI Hub Frameworks** define the architectural, operational, and governance standards used across all **Quantum AI Foundry** programs.  
They extend the **QAI Master Frameworks** into practical enterprise implementations and agile product delivery environments.

These frameworks ensure **coherence, compliance, and scalability** across all hybrid quantum–classical systems, from foundational research to industrial deployment.

## 2. Frameworks in this Directory

| Framework | Description | Scope |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **QAI Master Frameworks** | Defines the meta-architecture and QAI Process lifecycle. | Core Meta-Framework |
| **QAI Enterprise Framework** | Translates QAI architecture into organizational and business layers. | Enterprise Transformation |
| **QAI Agile Product Owner Framework** | Integrates Agile methodology with QAI system development. | Product Lifecycle & Delivery |

## 3. Core Design Principles
- **Standardization** — Unified models for architecture, deployment, and research.  
- **Scalability** — Extendable across industries and computational platforms.  
- **Compliance** — Embedded ethical and data governance controls.  
- **Automation** — Integrates with QAI Ops for intelligent orchestration.  
- **Interoperability** — Supports hybrid (quantum + classical) pipelines.

---

## 4. Governance Alignment

All frameworks align with:
- [Data Governance Policy](../../corporate/policies/Data_Governance_Policy.md)
- [AI Ethics Guidelines](../../corporate/policies/AI_Ethics_Guidelines.md)
- [Legal & Compliance](../../corporate/legal/README.md)
