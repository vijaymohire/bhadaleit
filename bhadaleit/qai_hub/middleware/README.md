# 🔗 QAI Middleware  
**Bhadale IT Hub – Quantum AI Foundry**

---

## 1. Overview

The **QAI Middleware Layer** acts as the **translation, communication, and coordination bridge** between all hybrid subsystems within the **Quantum AI Foundry**.  
It ensures seamless information exchange between **QAI Frameworks**, **Runtimes**, and **External Systems**, using secure and coherent hybrid communication mechanisms.

---

## 2. Purpose

The middleware provides:
- **Translation Services** for quantum–classical data conversion  
- **Communication Bus Protocols** for inter-process messaging  
- **Session Control and Routing** between runtime layers and cloud orchestrators  
- **Security and Synchronization** through the QAI Ops compliance pipeline

## 3. Middleware Subsystems

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **QAI Translation Services** | Converts and normalizes hybrid signals, encodings, and cognitive representations. |
| **QAI Communication Bus** | Routes data and control packets across distributed hybrid systems. |

---

## 4. Architecture
```
Frameworks ↔ Middleware ↔ Runtimes ↔ QAI OS ↔ Hardware (CPU–QPU)
```

The Middleware functions as the **semantic and protocol bridge**, managing:
- Format translation (bit ↔ qubit)  
- Event routing and task coordination  
- Policy enforcement for hybrid security and ethics compliance

## 5. Directory Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `QAI_Translation_Services.md` | Describes the hybrid signal and cognitive translation layer. |
| `QAI_Communication_Bus_Protocols.md` | Defines the QAI communication and transport protocols. |

---

## 6. Governance Alignment

All middleware operations comply with:
- [AI Ethics Guidelines](../../../corporate/policies/AI_Ethics_Guidelines.md)  
- [Data Governance Policy](../../../corporate/policies/Data_Governance_Policy.md)  
- [Legal and Compliance Framework](../../../corporate/legal/README.md)
