## 6. Subfolder Descriptions

### 6.1 Categories

Categorizes technologies into structured groups such as:

- Databases  
- Cloud Platforms  
- DevOps & CI/CD  
- AI, QAI, Analytics  
- Cybersecurity  
- Networking & Communication  
- ERP & Enterprise Applications  
- Storage Systems  
- Development Frameworks  
- Operating Systems  
- Quantum Platforms  
- Collaboration Tools  

Ensures consistent classification and lookup during planning and architecture work.

---

### 6.2 Inventory

Maintains a **complete organizational inventory** of all tools and technologies currently used, including:

- Tool name & version  
- Purpose & domain  
- Owner team  
- Deployment scope  
- Dependencies  
- Licensing model  
- Supporting documentation  

This acts as a single source of truth for audits, modernization, and compliance.

---

### 6.3 Mappings

Provides cross-domain mappings such as:

- Tool ↔ Product  
- Tool ↔ Service  
- Tool ↔ Architecture Layer  
- Tool ↔ Business Unit  
- Tool ↔ Compliance Requirement  
- Tool ↔ Data Flow or Integration  

Enables rapid understanding of how technologies interact across the enterprise.

---

### 6.4 Product Landscape

High-level visualization and grouping of:

- Product families  
- Enterprise stacks  
- Deployment boundaries  
- Cloud components  
- On-prem vs hybrid vs distributed systems  
- QAI integration points  

Useful for strategic planning, modernization, and capability analysis.

---

### 6.5 Role–Stack Matrix

Defines which technologies align with which organizational roles:

- Engineering  
- AI & QAI  
- Cybersecurity  
- DevOps  
- CloudOps  
- Data Engineers  
- Researchers  
- Analysts  
- Enterprise Architects  
- Product Teams  

Supports workforce planning, hiring, training, and role alignment.

---

### 6.6 Selectors

Contains selection frameworks for evaluating tools, including:

- Architecture fit  
- Security posture  
- Licensing & cost model  
- Integration feasibility  
- Scalability & performance  
- Community & vendor support  
- Compliance and regulatory alignment  

Used for RFPs, modernization initiatives, pilot evaluations, and enterprise decision-making.

---

### 6.7 Vendors

Maintains vendor-related intelligence:

- Vendor profiles  
- Product catalogs  
- Security & compliance certifications  
- Licensing terms  
- Support SLAs  
- Procurement models  
- Risk ratings  
- Partner integration readiness  

Helps with procurement, budgeting, compliance, and long-term strategy decisions.

## 7. Standard Workflow

    1. New tool or vendor identified
    2. Categorization under the appropriate domain
    3. Addition to the technology inventory
    4. Mapping to roles, products, and architecture layers
    5. Evaluation using selectors
    6. Vendor analysis (if applicable)
    7. Integration into product landscape
    8. Approval from Architecture & Compliance teams
    9. Inclusion into modernization or product roadmaps

---

## 8. Governance & Compliance

- All technologies must be classified before use in any product or service.  
- Tools requiring sensitive data integration must undergo compliance approval.  
- Vendor tools must be reviewed for security and licensing risk.  
- Inventory must be updated with version changes or deprecations.  
- Deprecated tools require a documented sunset plan.  
- All mappings must remain synchronized across business units.  
- Special rules apply for QAI, cryptography, and cross-border data systems.

---

## 9. Future Roadmap

- Introduce automated tooling discovery and dependency scanning.  
- Integrate QAI-driven decision models for tool selection.  
- Build live dashboards for inventory, role mapping, and vendor intelligence.  
- Expand quantum technology categories with deeper granularity.  
- Establish a centralized modernization scoring engine.
