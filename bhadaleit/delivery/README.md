# 🚀 Bhadale IT Hub — QAI Delivery Division

## Overview
The **Delivery Division** manages the **end-to-end lifecycle of Quantum AI (QAI) solutions** — from demonstrations and client onboarding to program execution, governance, and delivery readiness.  
It serves as the operational bridge between **Research**, **Engineering**, **Strategy**, and **Customer Engagement**, ensuring that every QAI project moves from prototype to production efficiently, securely, and with measurable impact.

This directory houses all **delivery enablement functions** and cross-functional support systems that keep QAI programs consistent, traceable, and scalable across domains.
