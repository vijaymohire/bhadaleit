# 🏢 Bhadale IT — Organizational Framework (ORG Framework)

The **Organizational Framework (ORG Framework)** defines the structural, procedural, and operational blueprint of the **Bhadale IT Hub**.  
It aligns all **Services, Products, Research, and Modernization** modules into a unified **organizational logic system**, ensuring agility, compliance, and scalability across all business units.

This repository forms the **nerve center** connecting every part of the QAI ecosystem — from frameworks and offers to UAT and operations.

## 🧭 Organizational Logic Map

### 🔹 Core Layers
1. **Entity Layer (01–02)** — Defines the structure and the base ORG framework.  
2. **Module Layer (03–06)** — Outlines domain modules for services, products, research, and modernization.  
3. **Offer Layer (07–10)** — Documents all formal offers to clients, governments, or internal divisions.  
4. **Procedure & Step Layer (11–18)** — Defines workflow granularity from approval to execution.  
5. **Results Layer (19–26)** — Captures all system, user, or analytical outputs (raw → optimized).  
6. **UAT Layer (27–30)** — Consolidates acceptance testing and validation by end-users.  
7. **Operations Layer (31–34)** — Final operational frameworks enabling live rollout and maintenance.

## 🔒 Governance & Compliance

- Each module must adhere to **Bhadale IT Org Governance Policy v1.5**  
- All offers and procedures must include:
  - Classification header (`Service`, `Product`, `Research`, or `Modernization`)  
  - Version & Confidentiality tags  
  - Approval metadata (Owner, Reviewer, Department, Timestamp)  
- Regular audits managed by **ComplianceOps** and **FederalOps** teams.  
- Integration with **AI Ethics Board** and **Data Protection Committees** for sensitive workflows.

## 🧾 Notes for Maintainers

- Maintain folder integrity and consistent numbering across all subdirectories.  
- Each subfolder should contain:
  - `README.md` — high-level documentation  
  - `/templates` — reusable procedure/offer templates  
  - `/docs` — supporting diagrams, forms, and policy references  
  - `/data` — if results or analytics are stored  
- Commit message format:  
  - `[ORG][Category][Action]: Description`  
  - Example: `[ORG][RESEARCH][Update]: Added new research UAT results for quantum sensor project.`
