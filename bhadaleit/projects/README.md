# 🧱 Bhadale IT — Projects Framework

The **Projects Framework** is the **execution layer** of the **Bhadale IT Hub ecosystem**, converting strategic **Programs** into **operational initiatives**.  
It provides a standardized environment for managing, tracking, and delivering outcomes across **Modernization**, **Products**, **Research**, and **Services**.  

Every project is integrated with **Org Framework**, **Operations Frameworks**, and **Infra** systems — ensuring intelligence, compliance, and lifecycle traceability across all deployments.
