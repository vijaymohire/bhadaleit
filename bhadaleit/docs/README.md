# 📘 Bhadale IT Hub — QAI Documentation Division

## Overview
The **Documentation Division** (`/bhadaleit/docs/`) serves as the **unified documentation, visualization, and reference hub** for the entire **Bhadale IT Hub Quantum AI (QAI)** ecosystem.  
It consolidates architectural diagrams, process blueprints, operational handbooks, and strategic documentation under a single, version-controlled framework.

This division supports engineers, strategists, researchers, and executives by offering **verified, indexed, and interlinked documents** covering both classical and quantum dimensions of the Bhadale IT Hub.
