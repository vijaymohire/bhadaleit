# 🧩 QAI Fundamentals

## Overview
The **Fundamentals Division** of QAI Research establishes the theoretical and mathematical groundwork for all Quantum Artificial Intelligence architectures.  
It unifies principles from **quantum physics, category theory, field theory, and hybrid intelligence** — serving as the bridge between quantum formalism and applied computational intelligence.
