# ⚖️ Patent Candidates — Confidential Research

## Overview
The **Patent Candidates Division** is a secure internal node of the **QAI Research Framework**, containing **proprietary, unpublished, and confidential research outputs** identified as patentable or pre-commercial intellectual property (IP).

This division functions as the **staging area for the QAI IP Lifecycle** — from concept identification → validation → patent documentation → transfer to the Legal & Compliance Division.
