# 🧠 Quantum AI Intelligence Division

## Overview
The **Intelligence Division** forms the cognitive and reasoning layer of the **Quantum AI (QAI)** ecosystem — the bridge between computation and consciousness.  
It explores the emergence, control, and alignment of **machine intelligence** through the synthesis of artificial, quantum, and bio-inspired models.

This domain studies the evolution from **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** → **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)** → **Quantum–Cognitive Entities**, guided by the ethical and structural frameworks of the QAI Civilization Roadmap.
