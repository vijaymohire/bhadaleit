## 1. Overview

The **Quantum AI R&D Lab** serves as the applied research and experimental innovation unit within the BhadaleIT Research Division.  
It complements the **QAI Research Hub** (theoretical research) and provides validated research outputs directly to the **QAI Product Foundry** for engineering, simulation, prototyping, and lifecycle execution.

This lab conducts hands-on experiments, concept validation, early modeling, and pre-patent design activities—positioning itself as the upstream scientific engine for the entire QAI ecosystem.

---

## 2. Mission

To transform foundational QAI theories into experimentally validated concepts, early prototypes, and pre-patent innovations that advance the QAI Product Foundry and accelerate end-to-end QAI product development.

---

## 3. Objectives

- Conduct applied research in Quantum AI, communication, sensing, and hybrid architectures.  
- Perform experiments, simulations, and evaluations that bridge theory with real-world feasibility.  
- Generate patentable concepts, diagrams, and design drafts for the IP division.  
- Prepare data, assumptions, and models for the QAI Product Foundry simulation and engineering layers.  
- Maintain research quality through structured methodologies, reproducible experiments, and controlled documentation.  
- Support TTO in preparing formal research transfer bundles for engineering teams.

## 8. Integration Rules

### 8.1 With QAI Research Hub  
- Pull theoretical models, frameworks, and mathematical constructs  
- Validate theory via applied experimentation  
- Push experimental evidence and correction feedback  

### 8.2 With QAI Product Foundry  
- Deliver only validated, reviewed, and structured inputs  
- Use standard transfer document templates  
- Collaborate with engineering teams when needed  
- Do not duplicate engineering or simulation workflows already in the Foundry  

### 8.3 With IP Division  
- Submit pre-patent packages through internal workflows  
- Maintain confidentiality according to classification rules  
- Follow naming conventions and IP-safe documentation standards  

---

## 9. Governance & Compliance

- Lab work must follow internal ethics, security, and confidentiality policies  
- All experiments must be documented in lab notebooks or logs  
- Only approved datasets can move to Foundry or external partners  
- IP-sensitive content must be encrypted and labeled  
- External lab usage (universities, partner labs) requires clearance from:  
  - TTO  
  - IP Division  
  - Infrastructure & Engineering Division  

---

## 10. Future Roadmap

- Expand applied quantum experiments using partner labs  
- Establish internal micro-fabrication testbenches (as budget permits)  
- Integrate with advanced Foundry simulations (multi-qubit benchmarks)  
- Enhance R&D → Foundry automation pipelines  
- Enable QAI-driven research automation and self-optimizing lab systems
