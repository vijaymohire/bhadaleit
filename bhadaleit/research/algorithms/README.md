# 🧮 QAI Algorithms Division

## Overview
The **Algorithms Division** focuses on the **computational logic and mathematical intelligence** that drive the Quantum AI (QAI) ecosystem.  
It serves as the intermediary between the **Fundamentals Division** (theory and physics) and **Applied Research Division** (engineering and systems), developing hybrid algorithms that combine **quantum mechanics**, **neural learning**, and **operations research** principles.

It builds a foundation for:
- **Hybrid learning cycles**  
- **Quantum control operations**  
- **Cognitive reinforcement systems**  
- **Optimization-driven intelligence**
