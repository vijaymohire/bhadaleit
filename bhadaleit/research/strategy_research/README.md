# 🧭 QAI Strategy Research Division

## Overview
The **Strategy Research Division** defines the long-term **vision, direction, and governance frameworks** guiding the Quantum AI (QAI) Civilization Program under Bhadale IT Hub.  
It synthesizes insights from all other research divisions — theoretical, applied, algorithmic, and cognitive — to create **global foresight models, ethical governance systems, and strategic alignment roadmaps** for the hybrid AI–Quantum era.

This division ensures that QAI’s evolution remains **technologically sound, ethically balanced, geopolitically aware, and socially beneficial**.
