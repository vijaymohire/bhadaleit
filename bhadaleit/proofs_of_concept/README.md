# 🧪 Bhadale IT — Proofs of Concept (PoC) Framework

The **Proofs of Concept (PoC) Framework** serves as the **experimental validation layer** of the **Bhadale IT Hub ecosystem**.  
It bridges theoretical design and operational execution, enabling early-stage verification of **Quantum–AI (QAI)**, **Hybrid**, and **Classical** innovations across edge, monitoring, and modernization environments.

Each PoC under this repository demonstrates the **viability**, **scalability**, and **integration potential** of next-generation QAI technologies before transitioning to full-scale **Projects** or **Programs**.

## 🧰 Standard PoC Template (`poc-template`)

Each new Proof of Concept must follow the **Bhadale IT PoC Template**, ensuring consistency, traceability, and repeatability.  
The structure typically includes:

- **`README_template.md`** — PoC overview, objectives, and evaluation criteria  
- **`architecture_diagram.png`** — system layout and flow diagram  
- **`experiment_setup.yaml`** — environment configuration and runtime parameters  
- **`test_results.csv`** — data logs and performance results  
- **`analysis_report.docx`** — validation summary, conclusions, and recommendations  
- **`transition_plan.md`** — proposal for scaling to project-level implementation  

---

## 🧾 Governance and Metadata Requirements

Each PoC must include a metadata header to ensure lifecycle traceability and review alignment:

```yaml
PoC Name: QAI Edge Intelligence Prototype

Version: v1.0
Confidentiality: Internal / Restricted / Public
Linked Program: Global QAI Edge Modernization Program
Start Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: Active / Completed / Under Evaluation
```

## 🧾 Notes for Maintainers

- Every PoC must include a unique ID (`poc-###`) following sequential order.  
- Ensure each folder contains `README.md`, `setup.yaml`, and result files.  
- All experimental data and reports should be archived securely in research storage.  
- Commit convention: `[POC][Category][Action]: Description`  
  Example: `[POC][EDGE][Add]: Added hybrid inference benchmark test results.`  
- Link validated PoCs to `projects/` or `research/` folders once approved by QAI Review Board.
