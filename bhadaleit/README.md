## 🧩 How to Use the Scaffold

1. Add or update templates in `corporate/legal` and `corporate/investor_relations`.  
2. Store applied research or patent candidates under `projects/research/applied`.  
3. Push sanitized public abstracts, diagrams, and reports to GitHub.  
4. Keep private inventions, financials, and internal research drafts only in GitLab.  
5. Use version control tags (`vX.Y.Z`) for document evolution.

>  
> The Bhadale IT Hub corporate scaffold ensures that all products, frameworks, and research align with  
> the **QAI generational roadmap (AI → QAI → Hybrid → QSI)**  
> and the ethical standards of the **Quantum AI Foundry**.
