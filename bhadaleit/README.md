# 🏗️ Bhadale IT Hub — Corporate Scaffold

This directory contains the **full organizational and technical scaffold** for  
the **Quantum AI Foundry** and associated Bhadale IT Hub operations.

## 🧭 Structure Overview

```
bhadaleit/
├── corporate/ → Legal, compliance, investor relations
├── delivery/ → Presales, operations, and delivery procedures
├── qai_hub/ → Core frameworks, middleware, and runtime layers
├── projects/ → Products, Services, Modernization, Research
├── analytics/ → Metrics collection and investor reporting
└── ...
```

## ⚙️ Repository Scaffold Automation

The scaffold was generated and maintained using:
create_company_scaffold_full.sh


This script creates:
- Folder hierarchies
- Default `README.md` and `.gitkeep` files
- Classification headers
- GitLab–GitHub synchronization references

Use this only when initializing or updating the corporate base structure.

## 🔗 Key Subdirectories

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `corporate/` | Legal, compliance, and investor relations documentation. |
| `delivery/` | Partner, presales, and operational templates. |
| `qai_hub/` | Core runtime, frameworks, middleware, and process definitions. |
| `projects/` | The 4-pillars (Products, Services, Modernization, Research). |
| `analytics/` | Automated metrics and investor reporting scripts. |

## 🧬 Integration with Private GitLab

All confidential, financial, or patent-bound materials are synchronized from the private repository:
bhadaleit-ip-hub/


| GitLab Folder | Public Mirror |
|----------------|----------------|
| `01_Patent_Candidates/` | `projects/research/patent_candidates/` |
| `03_Legal_&_Compliance/` | `corporate/legal/` |
| `04_Financials_&_Valuations/` | `corporate/investor_relations/` (sanitized only) |
| `07_Secret_IP/` | *Not mirrored publicly* |
| `08_Public_Docs/` | `projects/research/public_docs/` |

---

## 🧩 How to Use the Scaffold

1. Add or update templates in `corporate/legal` and `corporate/investor_relations`.  
2. Store applied research or patent candidates under `projects/research/applied`.  
3. Push sanitized public abstracts, diagrams, and reports to GitHub.  
4. Keep private inventions, financials, and internal research drafts only in GitLab.  
5. Use version control tags (`vX.Y.Z`) for document evolution.

## 🧱 Vision Alignment

> “From Quantum Fields to Applied Intelligence.”  
>  
> The Bhadale IT Hub corporate scaffold ensures that all products, frameworks, and research align with  
> the **QAI generational roadmap (AI → QAI → Hybrid → QSI)**  
> and the ethical standards of the **Quantum AI Foundry**.
